Last last thing: We don't want this conversation to end with the course ending. 

We're more excited than ever to hear from you, learn from you, and work toward existing in real community with you (_no offense, Several-Weeks-Ago You_).

If you want to continue in the community, **the only thing we ask is that you tell us you've finished the course.** This (non-anonymous) form asks for your username and a thumbs up that you're done with the course.
