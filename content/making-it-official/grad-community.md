Last last thing: we don't want our discourse to end with the course ending. 

We're more excited than ever to hear from you, learn from you, and work toward existing in real community with you (_no offense, Several-Weeks-Ago You_).

If you want to continue in the Community, **the only thing we ask is that you tell us you've finished the course.** 

This (non-anonymous) form asks for your username, which we'll use as a thumbs up that you're done with the course, and change you to a Graduate, which will give you full access to [community.sjmd.space](https://community.sjmd.space).
