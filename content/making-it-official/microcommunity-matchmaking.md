As we [mentioned](../../opening-doors/microcommunity), we'd love to put together microcommunities of SJMD grads to keep talking about the course subjects, provide one another support on their MVPs/Covenants, and/or collaborate on a creation for The Hub. 

If that sounds like something you'd love, we'll just need your name, contact information, wants from the group, and preferred contact method, then we'll email introduce everyone once we have a full group.

<center><small>**Would you like us to add you to a microcommunity of 5 - 6 other grads?**</small></center?>
