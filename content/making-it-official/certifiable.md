We can create a certificate for you showing that you completed the course. 

**This does not certify you as an "expert" in Social Justice, Minus Dogma (literally nobody should claim that expertise)**, just simply as a graduate of the SJMD Course.

If you want one, we'll have you fill out a short form that will ask for your name, email address, and a statement verifying that you completed the course, then we'll whip up a .PDF and email it to you.

This is _totally optional_ -- and we can't really fathom why you would want this, but we know that some of you do, because you told us so -- so...
