If you're not sure whether or not you're "done" with the course, here's our take: 

**We're done when we've enacted Living Social Justice, having dismantled dogma and oppression along the way.**

Until then, it's okay to feel like you're not done -- with this course, with your MVP Project idea, with your learning and unlearning in general! All of this, and all of us, are works in progress.

<small>But for now, without feeling the slightest bit of irony, please go ahead and click that "Done" button. We've got some fun things waiting for ya ðŸ‘‡</small>
