If there are unchecked checkboxes lingering in your SJMD To-Do list, worry not:

**Everything will be here after you go. And you don't lose access to any of the course materials when you graduate.**

So there's no rush! You can "Graduate", see what doors open to you on that front, and always pop back to that Module or Topic you didn't spend quite as much time on as you wanted.
