As a graduate of the SJMD Course, you'll have access to the rest of the SJMD Community (beyond just the course category).

Once you're cleared, we have several new categories waiting for you (like ["In the News"](https://community.sjmd.space/c/news) and ["(Un)Learning"](https://community.sjmd.space/c/un-learning)), and as many new threads as you can create: Oh yeah, you'll be able to create threads!

Other features will also open up to you as a graduate and trusted community member. We'll leave you to figure those out.
