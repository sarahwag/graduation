As a graduate of the SJMD Course, if you join the [SJMD Community](https://community.sjmd.space), you'll have access to an exclusive area that's reserved solely for SJMD Grads.

The Community has a lot of walled off areas, including one for students of the course, (Un)Learning, discussing topical news, and more. 

The SJMD Grads section is a space where you can chat with others knowing that they're in a similar place you are, having completed this course, wrestled with this topics, and committed several weeks to learning about social justice dogma.
