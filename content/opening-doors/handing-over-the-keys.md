Consider this us officially handing you the keys to open whatever SJMD-related doors you see in your future. Make yourself at home. _Nuestra casa es su casa._

Have an idea for how to use a Module (or the entire course) in your local community, IRL? Do it.

Want to convert something from the course into a different format (e.g., a video, or audio recording)? All the power to you.

Think there's a better way to create a platform for Living Social Justice than The Hub? Build it! You can even use our [source code](https://github.com/sjmd) if it helps.

We're here to show you the door. It's up to you to walk through it. Don't let us slow you down.
