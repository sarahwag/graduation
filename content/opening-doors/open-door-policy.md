We're like that cool college professor whose office hours were "Whenevs: I have an open door policy." 

But because our doors are websites, it doesn't matter that we're _never actually in our office_. There are no locks, and there's no need for you to wait in the hall for several hours. Cool.

We already covered how you'll still have access to the course. Now, let us tell you about a few new doors that will open up to you once you graduate.
