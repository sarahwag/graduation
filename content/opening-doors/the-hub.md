The Hub (https://hub.sjmd.space) is a forthcoming platform for SJMD grads and community members to share resources, articles, perspectives, and ideas with the broader social justice movement.

It will be a public gathering place to heal, to find community, to address and dismantle social justice dogma, and to share steps toward Living Social Justice.

The plan is for it to launch to the public September 1. As a graduate of this course, you'll get early access. Have something you want to say? You're also invited to submit something for publication!
