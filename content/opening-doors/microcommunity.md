This course has brought together social justice advocates from all around the world, with a wide array of passions, experiences, and perspectives. We want to make sure you get the chance to connect with one another, and forming microcommunities is one way to do so!

In a few minutes, **we're going to ask if you want to be paired with 5-6 other SJMD grads to form a microcommunity** to...

1. Keep discussing SJMD concepts, from naming dogma to proposing theses to finding paths toward living social justice;
2. Give one another support in completing your MVP / Covenant; and/or
3. Collaborate on a creation for the SJMD Hub (an essay, lesson plan, resource, idea, etc.).

If you want to be introduced to a small group of other SJMD grads, just give us a üëç and we'll do the rest (you'll know when!).
